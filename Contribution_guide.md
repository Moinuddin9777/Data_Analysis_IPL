### Contribution Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to our EDA project! Your help is essential in making this project better. Please follow this guide to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.

#### 1. **Setting Up the Environment**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x and any other relevant tools (Jupyter Notebook, etc.) installed.

#### 2. **Creating Your Contribution**
   - **Branching:** Create a new branch for each feature or fix, using a descriptive name, such as:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/add-visualization
     ```
   - **Notebook Standards:**
     - **Title and Description:** Every notebook should start with a clear title and a brief description of its purpose.
     - **Sectioning:** Use sections for each analysis step, like *Data Loading*, *Data Cleaning*, *Visualization*, and *Findings*.
     - **Clear Comments:** Comment your code to explain the reasoning behind each major step.
     - **Documentation:** Include markdown cells to explain key findings, charts, or transformations.
   - **Modularity:** If adding functions or classes, ensure theyâ€™re modular, reusable, and documented.

#### 3. **Data and File Management**
   - **Data Files:** Do not commit large datasets to the repository. Instead, add them to `.gitignore` or use a separate data repository.
   - **Outputs:** Only save final outputs (e.g., essential visualizations or summary reports) in a dedicated folder, such as `outputs/`.

#### 4. **Code Style and Formatting**
   - Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines for Python code style.
   - Ensure Jupyter notebooks are free of unnecessary cells or outputs before committing.
   - Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and file names.

#### 5. **Submitting a Pull Request**
   - **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
   - **Testing:** Ensure your code runs without errors and does not break any existing functionality.
   - **PR Description:** Describe your changes clearly in the pull request description, specifying the added features or issues addressed.
   - **Review and Feedback:** Be open to feedback and make necessary adjustments as requested.

#### 6. **Code of Conduct**
   - Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. Review the [Code of Conduct](link-to-code-of-conduct.md) for more details.
